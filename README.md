The project proposes an iterative tool to verify LLM code completions with CheckStyle and Infer in a feedback loop.

* For the required inputs, you could make the CheckStyle config optional by using a "reasonable default" config. This way you lower the barrier to using your tool, but still make it flexible and customisable.

* Clear methodology and evaluation, very well done!

* While CheckStyle and Infer are good tools, none of them can check for semantic correctness. For example, they can check that a fibonacci program is free of memory errors, and that variables are written in camelCase, but it cannot really check that it indeed outputs the fibonacci sequence. You could strengthen the tool by using a symbolic execution engine (like NASA Pathfinder for Java), and injecting the user's prompt to furthermore ask for behavioural assertions in the code.

ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: failed to create lease: read-only file system
Solution: Sometimes, the Docker daemon might encounter issues that could lead to a read-only file system error. Restarting the Docker service might resolve the problem. You can restart Docker on macOS by clicking the Docker icon in the menu bar and selecting "Restart".

# Creating a Java Test Class
This example involves a shared counter with two threads incrementing it. We'll introduce a potential for a race condition by not synchronizing access to the counter.

Counter.java

java
Copy code
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;  // This operation is not thread-safe
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Counter counter = new Counter();

        // Thread 1
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            }
        });

        // Thread 2
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Threads interrupted");
        }

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());
        // The expected count would be 2000, but due to race conditions, it might be less.
    }
}
# Compile and Run with Java Pathfinder
Compile the Program:
Compile Counter.java using the javac tool.

bash
Copy code
javac Counter.java
Create a JPF Configuration File:
Create a file named Counter.jpf to configure Java Pathfinder for this specific test.

Counter.jpf

properties
# Copy code
target=Counter
classpath=.

This tells JPF to target the Counter class and use the current directory for the classpath.

# Run JPF:

inside testJpf folder
 java -jar ./../jpf-core/build/RunJPF.jar HelloWorld.jpf```
